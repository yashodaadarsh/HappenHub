## Event Discovery Platform üöÄ

This document outlines the design and architecture of the **Event Discovery Platform**, a microservices-based system built to aggregate, process, and deliver personalized event (jobs, internships, hackathons) information to users.

## üèó System Architecture: Microservices with Event Streaming

The system employs a **Microservices Architecture** where each business function is isolated into an independent service. **Apache Kafka** is central to this design, acting as the high-throughput, fault-tolerant message broker for asynchronous, decoupled communication between services.

### Key Architectural Principles

* **Decoupling:** Services communicate primarily via asynchronous **event streams (Kafka)**, preventing cascading failures and allowing independent scaling.
* **Domain Isolation:** Each service owns its data store, ensuring autonomy and clear data boundaries (e.g., Auth Service owns `usersdb`, Event Service owns `eventsdb`).
* **Asynchronous Processing:** Long-running tasks, like data processing (DS Service) and search indexing (Search Service), are handled asynchronously via Kafka events.
* **Mixed Communication:** While Kafka is the backbone, direct **HTTP API calls** are used for synchronous operations, such as front-end requests to the Event or Auth services, and specific inter-service triggers (e.g., from Wishlist to Mail Service).

## üåê Data Flow and Communication

The platform's operation is defined by the lifecycle of two main entities: **Events** and **Users**.

### 1. Event Data Flow (Scrape $\rightarrow$ Publish $\rightarrow$ Consume)

1.  **Ingestion:** The **Scraping Service** polls external sources and **produces** raw data to the `scrap-data` Kafka topic.
2.  **Transformation:** The **DS Service** (Data Science/Processing) **consumes** `scrap-data`, cleans it, standardizes dates, and shortens descriptions. It then **produces** the cleaned data to the `event-data` topic.
3.  **Distribution/Indexing:** Multiple services **consume** the final `event-data` for their specific functions:
    * **Event Service** stores the official record in `eventsdb`.
    * **Search Service** indexes the data in `searchdb` for fast search capabilities.
    * **Recommendation Service** uses it to train models and generate user feeds.

### 2. User/Authentication Data Flow

1.  **Authentication:** The **Auth Service** handles sign-up and login, managing user credentials in `usersdb`.
2.  **Profile Events:** Upon significant changes (e.g., new user, preference update), the **Auth Service produces** a `user-data` event.
3.  **Consumption:** The **Recommendation Service consumes** `user-data` to update user profiles and personalize recommendations.

## üíª Microservices and Responsibilities

The system is composed of the following services, each with a dedicated role:

| Service | Primary Function | Communication Pattern | Data Store |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Scraping Service** | External data extraction. | Kafka Producer | N/A |
| **DS Service** | Data cleaning and enrichment (description shortening, date fixing). | Kafka Consumer/Producer | N/A |
| **Event Service** | Core event data management (CRUD operations). | Kafka Consumer, HTTP API | `eventsdb` |
| **Auth Service** | User authentication and identity management. | Kafka Producer, HTTP API | `usersdb` |
| **Search Service** | Fast search and filtering on all events. | Kafka Consumer, HTTP API | `searchdb` (Search Index) |
| **Recommendation Service** | Personalized event feed generation based on user preferences. | Kafka Consumer | `recommendationdb` |
| **Wishlist Service** | Manages user-event favorites and reminder logic. | HTTP API, Dedicated DB | `wishlistdb` |
| **Mail Service** | Sends transactional emails (e.g., expiring event reminders). | HTTP API/Kafka Consumer (triggered by Wishlist) | N/A |

## üîó Kafka Topics (Asynchronous Contracts)

| Topic Name | Producer Service(s) | Consumer Service(s) | Event Type |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **`scrap-data`** | Scraping Service | DS Service | Raw, uncleaned event JSON. |
| **`event-data`** | DS Service | Event, Search, Recommendation Services | Finalized, standardized event object. |
| **`user-data`** | Auth Service | Recommendation Service | User profile or preference changes. |
| **`mail-data`** | Wishlist Service (Inferred) | Mail Service (Inferred) | Payload to trigger an email send. |
